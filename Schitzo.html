					<br>
					The Moon called to me that night. <br> It called to me so bright that I immediately fell to the floor crying in the dull white light falling over my vision. The dull white became stronger and stronger, with the world around me becoming clearer 
					and clearer. <br> But <br> It wont stop <br> My eyes hurt, when I close my eyes I still see light burning through my eyelids as if I was staring at a nuclear bomb. <br> Whereever I go, I am only right there, blinded by the moon <br>
					The moon has become my sun and my hell and the only escape I have is my sunglasses at night. <br> Suddenly as I don my welding hood that I found using my sunglasses, it dims <br> the sun is rising over the horizon <br>
					Its calm warm rays coming over my body as tears fell down my cheeks. <br> my hell was over, but I dread the future. <br> 
					"Tell Him the moon the sun and hell start wearing sunglasses at night" - The Wise <br>
					"Whereever you go, There you are" - The Experienced <br> <br> <br>

					<br>
					The pus pus cable of the chewed and I thought to myself,<br> <br> What if the feline never existed and was simply there to guide me down a healtier life towards love. <br> The
					burps bellowed out of my gut as the cat swirled a chopstick in its paws as it dissappeared behind the monitor <br> It was gone <br> the pus pus left me behind just like others in my life<br> <br> suddenly I felt
					warmth on my shoulder and the calm purs as it rested my uneasy soul, feeling the pain and despiration in my words.<br> I type this as a reminder that once I pass, may the pus pus save someone elses life
					from falling down the dark dreaded path that I live. <br> The cat began to speak to me <br> "This is your time" <br> "how" <br> "The best time to start is always now" <br> it calmly said as its bright red and pink brainmatter splattered
					across the wall as a dark hooded man walked into the room, his beady red eyes staring into mine <br> "Wake up Joe Biden"
