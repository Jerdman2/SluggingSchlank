					The pus pus cable of the chewed and I thought to myself,<br> <br> What if the feline never existed and was simply there to guide me down a healtier life towards love. <br> The
					burps bellowed out of my gut as the cat swirled a chopstick in its paws as it dissappeared behind the monitor <br> It was gone <br> the pus pus left me behind just like others in my life<br> <br> suddenly I felt
					warmth on my shoulder and the calm purs as it rested my uneasy soul, feeling the pain and despiration in my words.<br> I type this as a reminder that once I pass, may the pus pus save someone elses life
					from falling down the dark dreaded path that I live. <br> The cat began to speak to me <br> "This is your time" <br> "how" <br> "The best time to start is always now" <br> it calmly said as its bright red and pink brainmatter splattered
					across the wall as a dark hooded man walked into the room, his beady red eyes staring into mine <br> "Wake up Joe Biden"
