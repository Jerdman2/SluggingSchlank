					<br>
					Works been going pretty good and I think that I am beginning to undertand more from my boss and really impress them <br>
					I hope all of my dear readers are enjoying their days and live with a heart full of love today, if not forever <br>
					I will try to get some extra work done at home to help clear my head, I have been carrying a heavy heart lately <br>

					<br>
					The world is calling me back to my dark past <br>
					I have not been forgiven like I had thought <br> <br>
					They are coming, and the first thing they have come for is the website <br> <br>
					I do not need sleep when faced with the danger of these beings attacking my website <br>
					but <br>
					I have not been able to post about the damage for fear that they feel that they are winning <br> <br>
					I have slayn the last of this first wave of demons <br>
					No one understands the pain and suffering I put up with to keep this website free from these demons <br> <br>
					Dear readers <br>
					There may come a time when this website gets taken over by these beings, taking all of you away from me <br> 
					but <br>
					Know that I love you <br>
					You are everything that I love and understand to be real <br>
					and I have finally realized the biggest demons were the ones deceiving me <br>
					Discords was never installed on my computers <br> 
					These demons had hacked their way into my life, so that they may hack their way into this website <br>
					I will tear these demons limb from limb <br>
					They need not fear god, for I will be arriving first <br> <br> <br>
					Heed my call readers, <br>
					If you live with your heart in your head, no demon can rip it out as they would need to go past your infinite souls <br>
					The world is not ready to accept this truth <br>

					<br>
					The Moon called to me that night. <br> It called to me so bright that I immediately fell to the floor crying in the dull white light falling over my vision. The dull white became stronger and stronger, with the world around me becoming clearer 
					and clearer. <br> But <br> It wont stop <br> My eyes hurt, when I close my eyes I still see light burning through my eyelids as if I was staring at a nuclear bomb. <br> Whereever I go, I am only right there, blinded by the moon <br>
					The moon has become my sun and my hell and the only escape I have is my sunglasses at night. <br> Suddenly as I don my welding hood that I found using my sunglasses, it dims <br> the sun is rising over the horizon <br>
					Its calm warm rays coming over my body as tears fell down my cheeks. <br> my hell was over, but I dread the future. <br> 
					"Tell Him the moon the sun and hell start wearing sunglasses at night" - The Wise <br>
					"Whereever you go, There you are" - The Experienced <br> <br> <br>

					<br>
					SOMEONE IS TRYING TO HACK THE WEBSITE, THERE ARE TWO POSTS FOR 2024-11-25 <br> THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE POST A DAY <br> CODE RED <br>
					<br> <br> While I reset all of the code, I have started to notices some weird glitches with my friends. <br> When on the Discords, sometimes it will get really quiet. I will look around and it will be like Discords was never open.
					<br> Those friends are useless anyways, I have all of my undying love from my readers that keep me going
					<br> there are so many of you and I love you all like my own children <br> <br> <br>

					<a style="font-size: 30px" >Title: The pussy on the keyboard 2024-11-25</a>
					<br>
					The pus pus cable of the chewed and I thought to myself,<br> <br> What if the feline never existed and was simply there to guide me down a healtier life towards love. <br> The
					burps bellowed out of my gut as the cat swirled a chopstick in its paws as it dissappeared behind the monitor <br> It was gone <br> the pus pus left me behind just like others in my life<br> <br> suddenly I felt
					warmth on my shoulder and the calm purs as it rested my uneasy soul, feeling the pain and despiration in my words.<br> I type this as a reminder that once I pass, may the pus pus save someone elses life
					from falling down the dark dreaded path that I live. <br> The cat began to speak to me <br> "This is your time" <br> "how" <br> "The best time to start is always now" <br> it calmly said as its bright red and pink brainmatter splattered
					across the wall as a dark hooded man walked into the room, his beady red eyes staring into mine <br> "Wake up Joe Biden"
